How it works:
    Downloads 1 page from the manga that the user provides
    Loops through that pages and gets all the chapter id's and chapter names
        Downloads the a chapter (stored from most recent to oldest) and find out how many pages there are
        Cleans up the chapter name (removes chars that can't be used as a folder name) and makes a new directory if one is not made already
        Stores the number of pages as int pages
            Loops through the pages and searches for the string "mgimgcdn.com" as the src in all the <img> tags on the page
            Downloads the img from the page and names it by the page number and last 4 of the file name (.png or .jpg)
            Closes the file and subtracts 1 from pages
            Repeates until all pages for the chapter are done downloading
        Subtracts 1 from int i which keeps track of what chapter is downloading (naming purpose only)
    Prints "All done" when finished
